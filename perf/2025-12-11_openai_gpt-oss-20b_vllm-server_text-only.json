For a sequence of length *L*, the cost of a single forward pass is *O(L\u00b2\u00b7d)*, where *d* is the hidden dimension.

When a new token arrives, only its Q, K, and V are computed; the new K and V are appended to the cache, and the attention scores are computed against the cached K and V. This reduces the per\u2011step cost to *O(L\u00b7d)* (linear in the current context length) instead of *O(L\u00b2\u00b7d)*, enabling real\u2011time decoding even for very long contexts.\n\n**Why It Matters for Long Context**\n\n1. **Computational Efficiency** \u2013 Without caching, each new token would trigger a full quadratic recomputation, making inference for 10k+ token contexts infeasible. KV caching turns this into a linear\u2011time operation, drastically cutting GPU memory bandwidth and compute time.\n\n2. **Memory Footprint** \u2013 The cache holds only the K and V tensors (typically 2\u00d7 *L\u00b7d* floats).

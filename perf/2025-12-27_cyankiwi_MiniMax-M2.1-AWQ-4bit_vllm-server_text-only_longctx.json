In Python 3.7+, the built-in `dict` also preserves insertion order, but `OrderedDict` was introduced in earlier versions for this purpose and still provides some additional methods.\n- **Internal Structure**: Uses a doubly linked list to maintain order. Each key is associated with a link in the linked list, and the links are connected in a circular manner. The internal `__map` dictionary maps keys to their links.\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `__iter__`: Iterates over keys in insertion order.\n  - `__reversed__`: Iterates over keys in reverse insertion order.\n  - `popitem(last=True)`: Removes and returns the last item (if `last=True`) or the first item (if `last=False`).\n  - `move_to_end(key, last=True)`: Moves an existing item to the end (or beginning if `last=False`).\n- **Use Case**: When you need to maintain the order of key-value pairs and also have the ability to move items to the end or pop from either end.\n\n### 2. namedtuple\n- **Purpose**: Creates a tuple subclass with named fields.

In Python 3.7+, the built-in `dict` also preserves insertion order, but `OrderedDict` provides additional methods like `move_to_end()` and `popitem(last=False)`.\n- **Use Case**: When you need to maintain the order of key-value pairs and also have the ability to move items to the end or pop from the beginning. Also useful for compatibility with older Python versions or when you need the specific methods of `OrderedDict`.\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `popitem(last=True)`: Remove and return the last (or first if `last=False`) item.\n  - `move_to_end(key, last=True)`: Move an existing item to the end (or beginning if `last=False`).\n\n### 2. namedtuple\n- **Description**: A factory function that creates a tuple subclass with named fields. It provides a way to create lightweight, immutable structures with named fields.\n- **Use Case**: When you need a simple data structure with named fields, similar to a record or struct. It is useful for returning multiple values from a function, or for defining a simple class without methods.\n- **",

This caching is particularly crucial for models that handle long sequences or require multiple passes over the same data, such as in tasks involving large documents or iterative refinement.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Transformer Architecture**: In a transformer, each layer processes input tokens through self-attention mechanisms, which involve generating queries, keys, and values. The keys and values are derived from the input tokens and are used to compute attention scores that determine how much each token should influence others.\n\n2. **Caching Mechanism**: During the processing of a sequence, the keys and values for each token are stored in the KV cache. This cache is then used in subsequent passes or for extending the sequence without recomputing these values from scratch.\n\n3. **Efficiency Gains**: By reusing the cached keys and values, the model reduces the computational overhead associated with reprocessing the same tokens.
